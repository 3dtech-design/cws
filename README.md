Did you just buy the Monoprice MP Mini Deluxe SLA LCD bla bla bla bla Resin super printer because it went on a crazy sale?  Cool!  How do you like the Creation Workshop software that comes with it?  Amazing, isn't it?  Anyhow... If you want to use Chitubox instead with your new printer, here is the plugin for you!

Currently, has only been tested with the Monoprice resin that came with the printer.  Likely, more testings and profiles to come.

There are currently 2 Chitubox profiles: 50mi - pretty much mimics the Creation Workshop version.  20 mi - you can trully squeeze out the 20 mi out of your printer, something that Creation Workshop / monoprice software does not do for you out of the box.  Enjoy and be happy!

If you like this plugin, which I bet you would, you should buy me a beer or two! :)
